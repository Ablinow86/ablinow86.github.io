	Greetings fellow travelers my name is Ablinow. Abe Leno also works. My goverment name is "Alexander Blinow" issued from birth in the corporate prison place known as the united snakes. The origins of modern technological dwelling space we now call the interwed, before the era of paranoid need for security from your neighbor it was common to use your first initial and your last name and maybe your birth year as a screen name. Over the years I have also developed a musical alias known to most as "ab+: Ay be postive". And as most know it is good advice I give to somne but myself struggle with negative thining patterns as well as general psychological imbalance. I find it quite interesting that most people i encounter in the healing community and work in mental health often are not farmiliarized with Jungs work like the shadow, the archetypes, anima/animus as awell as other things. Maybe I am just some Jungian fanboy but over the years Ive also been a Terrence MCkenna fan so you could say Im in that "stoned ape camp" of general weirdo artist types who arent afraid to be a weird human. </p>

	<p> From Bristol County massachusetts. I am simply documenting things as someone I look up to KRS one says we should write our history. And with this git hub I can update things even if it is ghetto and I cant get my plant picture to work right(someday). I tend to dabble and also go on binge type learning adventures and at one point I was doing codecademy for web stuff and still want to keep learning coding someday. I am typing much faster then I would write but I also think in the event of a technological shut down this would be not available. I could print these things. I consider my self a student of life, and hopefully a teacher of nice. I hold in a lot of anger and pain at times but Ive heard feeling is healing. I intend to go more into the DBTworkbook under my laptop right now after this a bit. As I grow older I consider myself trying to learn more about esoterica and mysticism anything with the occult in life. All these words kind of are hard to absorb and make sense of, I consider myself a seeker, but a lost soul who sometimes just pretends to seek, But the revelations I feel myself seem to align sometimes I think with things that I hear from that lady Sara Elkhaldy ; the alchemist on youtube. She was talking about ignorance is bliss. And in a way Ive thought myself more awareness equals more pain at times. A wider spectrum for feeling lower lows and higher highs. I think it is more comfortable at times to stay in that middle ground if you will. But one guy in my awakening discord channel his name is hopeISdope. He drops some stuff its hard to explain but you know that far out philosophy type .  Some of them were implying Alan Watts to be generic it seemed and I think we are all humans in there capable of our own bias. I think about how I watch stuff on youtube about Jung, or philosophy in general and feel I dont want to be decieved. I enjoy the channel: esoterica. With Dr Justin Sledge. Hes an academic but its hard to wrap your heard around alot of these far out concepts. But he also makes jokes and so does sara I wouldnt want someone with no humor and I think we know that shit is a gift from the source. I recently had an unexpected hiatus and intend to work more at being my authentic self on a mission from reality. Break the matrix by creating our own plantation of ideas into the univeral dopeness that flows through everything. I Knew when I first started writing raps it felt right, I havent got to my peak but its coming. I wanna start a website where i can sell some songs . I know this is done unporoffesionally and most of my stuff is, But I think I can work it all into shape through efforts and refining process. I think of not uploading this but in the event of my death idk feels right, I just fell on some ice and feel im fine but also you never know. But so far seems Ive been sticking around for a purpose. Time to find that thing, or do this thing. or something  </p>
