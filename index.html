	Greetings fellow travelers my name is Ablinow. Abe Leno also works. My goverment name is "Alexander Blinow" issued from birth in the corporate prison place known as the united snakes. The origins of modern technological dwelling space we now call the interwed, before the era of paranoid need for security from your neighbor it was common to use your first initial and your last name and maybe your birth year as a screen name. Over the years I have also developed a musical alias known to most as "ab+: Ay be postive". And as most know it is good advice I give to somne but myself struggle with negative thining patterns as well as general psychological imbalance. I find it quite interesting that most people i encounter in the healing community and work in mental health often are not farmiliarized with Jungs work like the shadow, the archetypes, anima/animus as awell as other things. Maybe I am just some Jungian fanboy but over the years Ive also been a Terrence MCkenna fan so you could say Im in that "stoned ape camp" of general weirdo artist types who arent afraid to be a weird human. </p>
