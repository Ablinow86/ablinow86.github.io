  <h1 class="hh1">ALEX BLINOW (BLINOV)</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website! SMOKE THAT GOOD ISH</p>
	<br> <br> <p> 	Exiting the matrix next stop euphoria~land.... Just kidding consider this a foreword. I am not a firm believer of myself to be from outer space or anything specifc. I am a very sketpical person deep within as well as I am also someone to trust the universe. Just like anyone I have my rigid conformity to the modern world. Ive been determined to experiment with creativity more since I heard of the four agreements. But lets this be a disclaimer that this is for entertainment mainly of myself. And therapy. So dont take anything I say too seriously. I am simply documenting my record on my own file from my perspective. If it gives me something to do and I dont get as insanely depressed I think it will be a good thing . Also I may revise this later in life and cherry pick things but the grammar is going to be very LOL quick typing style not actually proper. Im into hip hop and I can type faster in this sense. As I see things I can correct them. Also theres a link to my rap song "no way" and a background music file to play. Forgive my primitve coding skills. </p>
  <p> To anyone who wants to work together musically as an artist rapper or just in general get contact with me for collaboration. My email is ablinow86@gmail.com. I am hoping that like some claim when you find your path you will also find others on a similar life mission. I really have always felt real hip hop in my soul, GIFT OF GAB    r.i.p.   seriously take a moment ... KRS is still here but GAB was something else imo. So my mission is to the real deal hip hop. Ive has apprehension to challenge paradigm as a pale guitarist type. But the soul cannot be denied. I could put my phone here or something too cuz Im real like that. Maybe someday more then a few people will see this. This is also an example of the time effort and use of the interweb can lead to amazing things as we all know. Power to the poeple. I will be posting some random stuff soon for my sanity . <br> <br> <br> </p>

  <p>    Ablinow "Ramblings of a lunar tick: stories of a parasite from the moon"

		moondate:13-1-2620
	Greetings fellow travelers my name is Ablinow. Abe Leno also works. My goverment name is "Alexander Blinow" issued from birth in the corporate prison place known as the united snakes. The origins of modern technological dwelling space we now call the interwed, before the era of paranoid need for security from your neighbor it was common to use your first initial and your last name and maybe your birth year as a screen name. Over the years I have also developed a musical alias known to most as "ab+: Ay be postive". And as most know it is good advice I give to somne but myself struggle with negative thining patterns as well as general psychological imbalance. I find it quite interesting that most people i encounter in the healing community and work in mental health often are not farmiliarized with Jungs work like the shadow, the archetypes, anima/animus as awell as other things. Maybe I am just some Jungian fanboy but over the years Ive also been a Terrence MCkenna fan so you could say Im in that "stoned ape camp" of general weirdo artist types who arent afraid to be a weird human. </p>

	<p> From Bristol County massachusetts. I am simply documenting things as someone I look up to KRS one says we should write our history. And with this git hub I can update things even if it is ghetto and I cant get my plant picture to work right(someday). I tend to dabble and also go on binge type learning adventures and at one point I was doing codecademy for web stuff and still want to keep learning coding someday. I am typing much faster then I would write but I also think in the event of a technological shut down this would be not available. I could print these things. I consider my self a student of life, and hopefully a teacher of nice. I hold in a lot of anger and pain at times but Ive heard feeling is healing. I intend to go more into the DBTworkbook under my laptop right now after this a bit. As I grow older I consider myself trying to learn more about esoterica and mysticism anything with the occult in life. All these words kind of are hard to absorb and make sense of, I consider myself a seeker, but a lost soul who sometimes just pretends to seek, But the revelations I feel myself seem to align sometimes I think with things that I hear from that lady Sara Elkhaldy ; the alchemist on youtube. She was talking about ignorance is bliss. And in a way Ive thought myself more awareness equals more pain at times. A wider spectrum for feeling lower lows and higher highs. I think it is more comfortable at times to stay in that middle ground if you will. But one guy in my awakening discord channel his name is hopeISdope. He drops some stuff its hard to explain but you know that far out philosophy type .  Some of them were implying Alan Watts to be generic it seemed and I think we are all humans in there capable of our own bias. I think about how I watch stuff on youtube about Jung, or philosophy in general and feel I dont want to be decieved. I enjoy the channel: esoterica. With Dr Justin Sledge. Hes an academic but its hard to wrap your heard around alot of these far out concepts. But he also makes jokes and so does sara I wouldnt want someone with no humor and I think we know that shit is a gift from the source. I recently had an unexpected hiatus and intend to work more at being my authentic self on a mission from reality. Break the matrix by creating our own plantation of ideas into the univeral dopeness that flows through everything. I Knew when I first started writing raps it felt right, I havent got to my peak but its coming. I wanna start a website where i can sell some songs . I know this is done unporoffesionally and most of my stuff is, But I think I can work it all into shape through efforts and refining process. I think of not uploading this but in the event of my death idk feels right, I just fell on some ice and feel im fine but also you never know. But so far seems Ive been sticking around for a purpose. Time to find that thing, or do this thing. or something  </p>
    <br><p> moondate 14-1-2620  <br> "crazy cat laddie" <br> After my recent hiatus I am happy to call myself a crazy cat laddie. This means someone who is a bit inane and spends a lot of time alone with his cats. I am 39 and I have had one GF when I was 31. My twenties were filled with drinking and chasing women unsuccessfully. I know I dont want to go crazy over being lonely. But I also know I want to keep trying to get out there. Its difficult to not become discouraged and think "women only like tall guys" or any general negative statement. I know this isnt true and I have had some success in ways but tend to be a traumatized mind overthinker werid nervous broken person who doesnt bode well in the dating pool, Maybe I could re work my online profile but I also try to appear genuine, My whole life Ive been a people pleaser afraid to step on toes. Afraid of conflicts. It seems girls would prefer someone with a backbone who doesnt shy away from difficult situations with people. Over the years I have learned to communicate but it feels artifical at times. And at other times I am guilty of emotional breakdowns where it appears my unconscious woes overwhelm my state of being. Growing up my sister was a very strong persona, filled with anger, and depression mostly due to the lack of a father figure. My mother struggled trying to mantain order in the household and I must have adjusted to living without making waves. My father moved to floria when when I was like 11 or something. He had a business which they didnt pay the unconstituitonal income tax and was shut down. Then him and his new family moved to Boca Raton to restart with the help of his inlaws. I held a lot of anger but as a grown man child myself now I can see how if giben the chance I could impregnate someone and do the wrong things as a father. We didnt talk for years but when I recovered from whipples disease we reconnected. I remember him saying you know "men usually think with their d*ck" or somthing like that. I wondered if that refered to prior or later relations or both. Either way the truth hurts but I know the feeling to well as a lonley old person looking for someone, and at the same time not getting many opportunites you tend to not be too choosey. And lets all be real anyone who is from the sincere true self and isnt afraid to be weird and abnormal in society, this may sabatoge some opportunites. Then again those opportunies may not last due to a fake base of foundation. All I know is I do not want to be seperated from my cats again. And they dont want that I feel either. Over and Out.  <br> ABe LEno </p>
    <p style="color: green;">   ablinow AB+ "message to the meek"  14-1-2620  <br> This is just a little rant for the ones who need it. The people who may have heard of my music just recently or maybe never and ended up here however. "Don't you worry nothin's under control, it's just an illusion, a lie you've been sold" -ablinow. Thats a quote from a song I wrote called "we're gonna live". I do it for the love not the money so whatever comes out it is enough for me. I sometimes feel like an imposter when it comes to surrending to life and rolling with the hard punches, but Ive been somewhat tested in my 39 years and here I am still preachin the positive. Granted Ive always seen myself talk about balance of negative and positive over the years. Never be fake positive make sure you feel your pain and express your negativity. In Jungian psychology dysfunction mostly occurs when people avoid the pain they are supposed to feel. Everyone knows its good to let it flow, but once we have a block it gets hard to open the flow. It is okay to open the flow. Everything will be okay. Even if its not "okay". Nothing matters as much as we feel it does. Life and death are cousins and children of the same universe. One thing we need to realize is the pain is never as bad as we make it out to be in our minds. The worst pain is the fear of pain in my opinon. Nobody wants to feel it but through laugher and perserverence we can tolerate pain and still make great choices. I had a rare disease called whipples. So perhaps I could be a 'wounded healer". Im open to it but not trying to explain myself or slap a label on whatever I am. I can be toxic and negative in extreme amounts at times. But I can also be funny, healing, and postitive. Trying to find a balance.  </p>
     <p> 15-1-2620	"DIary from the badlands" Turtle Island aftermath. Ablinow here. Abe-original, intelex being hybrid agent ABe86 reporting from zone 58 known as the cursed county. Taunton a great place to good buisness. A horrible place to exist. Half kidding of course. I love the city for the art but boy do I see the suffering. And when I let my mind go off on the kind of human experiments that go on its incredible. I am your local footbag fanatic rap character ABe LEno aka Alexander Blinow in real life. I am just a regular short order cook on a hip hop mission with a bit of a side struggle in the weed life. I really enjoy Mendo Dope. This idea is working for me to express myself but I also think because its public I should try to get the most instantaneous use out of it. My theory is if you live life right from the heart and make your own record of things people will understand you to the best of their ability. I try to not live in fear and I do not consider my self fearless. But maybe I should give myself some credit for facing some fears at tines. Not a big snake person maybe one day I will get into holding them. I have friend with a python. Peace out stay POSI find HOBBIES -ablinow </p>
